# secret_manager

The purpose is to showcase using the SecretManager API through a simple app that requires securely storing and accessing credentials in a cloud function.

Functionality - manage your google docs with:

- front end: Flutter

## Current state of the project

The [enspyrco/the_process](https://github.com/enspyrco/the_process) project was using Secret Manager but it was not neccessary according to the set of requirements so the extra dependency was removed.

This repo was created and the relevant code was transferred over.

The next step is to define a simple app that will showcase the Secret Manager so we have code we can easily move in to a new project that requires a more secure solution.

- having client side secret management would  be good (maybe an admin feature?)

The code from the original project needs to be cleaned up.
